        <h2>About Ronaldo</h2>
        <p>
          Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with
          Manchester United in 2003, aged 18, winning the FA Cup in his first
          season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League
          titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23,
          he won his first Ballon d'Or.

        <h2>Player profile</h2>
        <p>
          A versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as
          well as through the centre of the pitch, and, while ostensibly
          right-footed, is very strong with both feet. Tactically, Ronaldo
          has undergone several evolutions throughout his career.
